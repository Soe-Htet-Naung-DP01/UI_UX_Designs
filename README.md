 ***This is a reupload of my UI UX designs of my university projects as part of DesignThinking Modules.***
 UI UX wireframes as part of university projects; some group projects, some individual, using AdobeXD, Balsamiq, Axure and Figma.
 **Scrum files are all made within 2 days using Agile Methods with randomly assigned group members.**
